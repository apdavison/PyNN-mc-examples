# A showcase for simulations of multicompartmental models with PyNN

To install PyNN, NEURON and Arbor:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

To run all examples and open the resultant figures:

    $ sh run_all.sh


Please note that multicompartment support in PyNN is still under active development,
and should not be used for scientific work yet.
